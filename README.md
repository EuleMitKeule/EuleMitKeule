## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/EuleMitKeule)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Lennard, a software developer and computer science student from Germany.</br>

I love working on open-source projects and contributing to the community. I'm particularly interested in home automation, game development and reverse-engineering.</br>

My projects often involve [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) custom integrations, the [Unity engine](https://unity.com).</br>
My favorite and most fluent programming languages are Python and C#.</br>

I hope that you will find something that is useful or interesting to you here.
